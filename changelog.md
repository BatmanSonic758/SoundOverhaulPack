## Version 3.1 (Batman Sonic's Birthday Bash!!!)
Happy birthday to me :D
No need to redownload the mod, but highly recommended.
If you already have the mod installed, copy paste every file from either the Full Package of Base Files .rar files except from mod.ini.

- Reorganized the config file, the options are now divided into three categories: Characters, Skills and Miscellaneous. 
- Tweaked Supreme's sounds (Thanks SuperNova124 :D)
- Added I'm Here [Re-Edit] to Another Story.
- Added small tweaks to I'm Here: Revisited.
- An option to add The End's monologue to Another Story.
- Added triangle jump sound when Sonic jumps with an animal in Another Story's Cyber Space / with a Koco.
- More sounds for Knuckles and Amy, especially Knuckles.
- 8 (technically 10) edited cutscenes, including both HD and 4K versions.
- Restored unused Camera Gaze sound (a sound now plays when you press Right Stick when you lock on into a target, I call it a focus lock on).
- Added a Forces-like spin jump sound for all characters (yes, even Amy).
- Added a tired sound for Tails.
- Added a sound (inspired by Amy) when each character enters that flip animation when interacting with terrian.
- Added a unique boost sound for Super Sonic, similar to previous titles.
- Added a fix for boost sounds being missing for Tails and Amy (normally missing when boosting on rails with max rings)

## Version 3.0.2

## Version 3.0.1

## Version 3.0 (REVISED)
- Reworked to be compatible with The Final Horizon (Update 3).
- Perfect Parry sound plays when doing a regular Parry.
- Removed Sonic's voice clips.
- "Shut Up Sonic Add-On" is now part of the main mod.
- New sounds and voice clips were added via code injection (supports all 4 characters).
- Tails, Knuckles and Amy are fully supported.
- Removed Sonic's presets for now.
- Adjusted Super Sonic's Titan QTEs.
- Reverted Sonic's Drift sound to vanilla.
- Added an option that allows you to either turn on or off Sonic's comments in the Guardian intros / Titan sequences.
- Added an option that allows you to choose which theme you want to play in Another Story's Ouranos Island.
- Added an option that allows you to choose which theme you want to play in Cyber Space (base game and Another Story).

You know what? Screw you, Hamas! I'm releasing this mod anyway!
So... it's finally here, the big update is out, and I'm very proud of what I'm made, it was made purely from love and oddly enough I used the Shut Up Sonic Add-On as a base for this version :)
Sonic's friends use a lot of sounds from '06 since I found them more appealing. Also keep in mind that it is just a demo since I have more features and ideas to come which as of now, I couldn't add them due to technical issues.
