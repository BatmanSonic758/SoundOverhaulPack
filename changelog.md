You know what? Screw you, Hamas! I'm releasing this mod anyway!
So... it's finally here, the big update is out, and I'm very proud of what I'm made, it was made purely from love and oddly enough I used the Shut Up Sonic Add-On as a base for this version :)
Sonic's friends use a lot of sounds from '06 since I found them more appealing. Also keep in mind that it is just a demo since I have more features and ideas to come which as of now, I couldn't add them due to technical issues.
